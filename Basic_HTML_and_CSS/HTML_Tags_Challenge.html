				<h2> About the Space</h2>
				<p>Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions. 
					In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. 
					Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.</p>

				<summary>Gottfried Leibniz's view of the space </summary>
				<p>For Leibniz, then, space was an idealised abstraction from the relations 
					between individual entities or their possible locations 
					and therefore could not be continuous but must be discrete.
					Leibniz regular time is  <time>  12:00 </time> to <time>17:00</time>
