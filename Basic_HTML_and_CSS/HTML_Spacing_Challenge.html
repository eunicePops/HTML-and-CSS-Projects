	<h1> Psalm&nbsp23 </h1>
	<p>
		The Lord is my sheeperd,<br>
		I shall not want <br>
		He makes me to lie down<br>
		In greeen pastures <br>
		He leads me beside the still waters<br>
		He restores my soul <br> 
		He leads me in path of righteousness<br>
		for His name sake<br>
		<span style="color: purple; font-weight:bold">Even though I walk through the valley shadow of death<br></span>
		I shall fear no evil <br>
		for though hath with me <br>
		thy rod and thy staff they comfort me <br>
		thy laid a table before me<br>
		in the presence of my enemies<br>
		Thou annoited my head with oil<br>
		my cup runs over <br>
		Surely God's goodness and mercies <br>
		shall follow me <br>
		All the days of my life <br>
		And I shall dwell in the house <br>
		of the Lord <br>
		forever and ever <br>
		Amen<br>
